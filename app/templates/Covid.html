            <h5 class="display-6 "><strong>Covid-19 Update</strong></h5>
            <p class="lead"> The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic loss of human life worldwide and presents an
                unprecedented challenge to public health, food systems and the world of work. The economic and social
                disruption caused by the pandemic is devastating: tens of millions of people are at risk of falling into
                extreme poverty, while the number of undernourished people, currently estimated at nearly 690 million,
                could increase by up to 132 million by the end of the year.

            </p>
            <p class="lead">Millions of enterprises face an existential threat. Nearly half of the worldâ€™s 3.3 billion
                global workforce are at risk of losing their livelihoods. Informal economy workers are particularly
                vulnerable because the majority lack social protection and access to quality health care and have lost
                access to productive assets. Without the means to earn an income during lockdowns, many are unable to
                feed themselves and their families. For most, no income means no food, or, at best, less food and less
                nutritious food.

            </p>
            <p class="lead">The pandemic has caused distress in many supply chains ranging from agriculture to real
                estate.</p>
            <h2 class="display-6 ">Education</h2>
            <p class="lead">COVID-19 has affected all levels of the education system, from pre-school to tertiary
                education. Different countries have introduced various policies, ranging from complete closure in
                Germany and Italy [19] to targeted closure in the United Kingdom for all but the children of workers in
                key industries.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">COVID-19 has had an impact on social mobility whereby schools are no longer able to provide
                free school meals for children from low-income families, social isolation and school dropout rates. It
                has also had a significant impact on childcare costs for families with young children.</p>
            <h2 class="display-6 ">Healthcare and the pharmaceutical industry</h2>
            <p class="lead">The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented challenge for healthcare systems
                worldwide. In particular, the risk to healthcare workers is one of the greatest vulnerabilities of
                healthcare systems worldwide. Considering most healthcare workers are unable to work remotely,
                strategies including the early deployment of viral testing for asymptomatic and/or frontline healthcare
                staff is imperative [60]. High healthcare costs, shortages of protective equipment including N95 face
                masks, and low numbers of ICU beds and ventilators have ultimately exposed weaknesses in the delivery of
                patient care. In the US, there is concern regarding uninsured individuals, who may work in jobs
                predisposing them to viral infection which may lead to significant financial consequences in the event
                of illness.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Profound changes to the dynamics of healthcare are likely to ensue, leading to massive
                investment into disease prevention infrastructure, and the accelerated digital transformation of
                healthcare delivery. Nicola et al. have highlighted the change in healthcare policy and clinical
                management as new evidence emerges [62]. In the US, active pharmaceutical ingredients are imported
                largely from India (18%) and the EU (26%), while China accounts for 13%. China is also the biggest
                exporter of medical devices to the US, accounting for 39.3%. Production slow-downs and limitations in
                supply would inadvertently lead to revenue loss [63]. In the UK, AstraZeneca have indicated that
                COVID-19 is likely to affect its 2020 revenue growth.</p>

<h5 class="display-6 "><strong>NJIT To Host Community COVID-19 Vaccination Center</strong></h5>
<p class="lead">New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) is pleased to announce our partnership with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the New Jersey Office of the Governor, the Department of Defense (DoD), the New Jersey State Police (NJSP), the New Jersey Office of Emergency Management (OEM), and other agencies to open a new COVID Community Vaccination Center on the NJIT campus. The Naimoli Center on NJIT's campus in Newark, N.J. will serve as the hub for vaccine activity at the new COVID Community Vaccination Center. NJIT is working aggressively to prepare for the coming launch of this important initiative on Wednesday, March 31. This center is expected to deploy up to 6,000 doses of vaccine per day and will help save lives, aid in our local and statewide recovery efforts, and expedite our return to normalcy. NJIT is exceptionally proud to be part of this effort and is appreciative of President Biden, Governor Murphy, and the federal and state agencies that are collaborating with NJIT to make this possible and to get this center up and running expeditiously.</p>

<p class="lead">NJIT specifically selected the Naimoli Center location for vaccine distribution in order to minimize the potential impact on our campus community by keeping traffic to the vaccination center on the perimeter of campus. NJIT is also establishing procedures and protocols designed to prevent the operations of the vaccination center from encroaching upon the majority of our campus or significantly disrupting daily life at NJIT.</p>

<p class="lead">The vaccine center is scheduled to be open through at least May 31, and it is anticipated that, once fully open, the vaccination center will be operational seven days a week.</p>

<p class="lead">NJIT is proud to be part of this important effort to increase vaccine access throughout our region, which will help expedite our recovery and will save lives in our community. Thank you all for your support, cooperation, and patience as NJIT embarks upon this massive and essential undertaking.</p>
